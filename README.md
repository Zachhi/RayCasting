# Ray Casting

Simple ray casting simulation that shows how rays of light would behave depending on its source location and the walls around it

**Note: If you do not have access to Visual Studio, here is a version that works for linux and windows: https://github.com/Zachhi/RayCasting-Linux**

## Demo

## Controls

* Click twice to draw a wall from the first click to the second click
* "C" to clear all walls
* Move mouse around to change light source position
* "Space" to change the source type. 
      3 Types:
      Draw all the light rays 
      Draw only the light rays that hit walls
      Draw no light rays
* "Up arrow" to increase amount of light rays
* "Down arrow" to decrease amount of light rays
* "Escape" to exit the program
